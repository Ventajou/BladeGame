BladeGame
=========

This repository will contain all of the code for a series of articles I'm writing on HTML5 game development using the [Blade C# to JavaScript compiler](https://github.com/vannatech/blade).

## Demos ##
You can access the demos [here](http://ventajou.github.com/BladeGame/Web/).

## Where can I find the articles? ##
On BuildNewGames:

* [Compiling to JavaScript: What, Why, and How?](http://buildnewgames.com/compiling-to-javascript/)

## Code organization ##
The master branch will contain the most up to date code, while there will be a branch for each article in the series. For example, the article\_1 branch will contain all of the code pertaining to the corresponding article. As each article will build on top of the previous one, so will the branches. For example, article\_2 will be article\_1 plus new or modified code.

The code is organized in folders, in the following manner:

- Framework: contains the source of a sample game framework or engine with the common components used by the various demos and games.
- Demos: gathers all of the various demos and sample games that will be created to illustrate the various topics covered in the articles.
- Web: the simple website used to host the [demos](http://ventajou.github.com/BladeGame/Web/).

## Building the code ##
To build the code, you will need a Windows computer with the .NET Framework v4.0 or better. In addition, you will need to install the [Blade compiler](https://github.com/vannatech/blade).

**Note: For the time being, the Blade installer requires Visual Studio 2010 to be installed, I'm working with the author to address that.**

These should be enough for you to build from the command line, using the MSBuild tool:

	msbuild BladeGame.sln

MSBuild can be found hidden in the depth of the Windows directory in the .Net Framework folder, for example:

	C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319

But if you're like me, you'll prefer to use an IDE to develop and build, for that you have a few choices:

- Visual Studio 2012 or 2010.
- [SharpDevelop](http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/), which is an excellent open source IDE written in .NET.

Note: Visual Studio Express and MonoDevelop are currently not supported but you may be able to get them to work with some tweaking.
